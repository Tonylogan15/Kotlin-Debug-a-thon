AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: Antonio Logan

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

Summary

Kotlin Debug-a-thon is an Android app that initially contained several intentional Kotlin bugs spread across different activities. After fixing them, the app now correctly performs navigation, displays calculated values, shows the current day, generates random colors, prints lists, and displays a favorite number. This project strengthened my debugging skills, improved my understanding of Kotlin error handling, and gave me more confidence navigating Android Studio.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 🐛🔧🚀

Notes

This project helped me understand common Kotlin pitfalls such as nullability errors, infinite recursion, incorrect casting, and out-of-bounds indexing. I also got more practice wiring up XML layout IDs correctly with Kotlin code and improved my ability to read stack traces and debug crash logs.
